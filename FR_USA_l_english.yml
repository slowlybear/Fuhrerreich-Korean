#### Events ####

US.1.d:0 "Since its inception, America’s relation with foreign intervention has been troubled and muddied to say the least. But in the past couple decades, the world has changed so drastically and the United States’ relation with the major powers of the world has been greatly strained. With the recent dissolution of the Bull Moose Party back into the Republican Party, the legacy of the late Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt has been called into question. After his main political opponent, Woodrow Wilson, was forced out of the Presidential race in 1912 following a heart attack, Roosevelt was barely able to win at the ballot boxes, ushering in a new and expansionist philosophy to the American zeitgeist. Not least on his radar was the brewing tides of war in Europe, which he was determined to keep the country out of, choosing to focus on the neighbors. \n\nThis was rendered impossible however- when Mexican nationalist Victor Carranza took power in Mexico, he became a formidable southern force. Brought to arms by the Americans’ recent occupation of Veracruz in the Tampico Affair, he mobilized his army- not for the offense, but to defend the country. As the Mexican Revolution wound down, a new war would start, and Germany would be the match that would light the tinderbox. The Zimmerman Declaration was decoded almost as quickly by American spies as Mexican ones, and what may have initially been swept aside was instead cast as a move to war. And neither side was going to back down. What began on 18 February 1917 in Mexico with the stroke of Roosevelt’s pen would not end until 11 November 1919 in Germany, and hundreds of thousands of American casualties would prove America’s place in the Entente’s victory. While at the Treaty of Marseilles, President Roosevelt would try to convince the powers of the world to agree to his “10 Points”- a document that would enforce a moderate peace, and hopefully a new faction of the democracies from America itself to France to even Japan. \n\nIts failure, and Roosevelt’s consequent infuriation at the insolence and disregard of Sir Lloyd George and Georges Clemenceau would bring him to declare, after leaving the conference “not to trust the Allies nor the Germans, for it seems that it is solely America’s duty to protect itself and its interests”. From then on, aside from trade as usual, the United States’ diplomacy with Europe went decidedly cold. The country became focused solely on its conquered neighbor to the south, installing a puppet regime and more than a few watchful eyes. After the death of Theodore only a couple short months later, the United States would be on the rise for near a decade; a combination of war profiteering and exploitation of the new Mexican puppet state. Presidents John J. Pershing (now a renowned war hero), Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover have passed in succession- the election of 1928 being particularly heated between Hoover and incumbent son Quentin Roosevelt. Now, 1936 has come, and the political scene has been largely shaped by the horrendous downturn of 1929- “Gilded Tuesday” that has near ruined America’s economy. \n\nIn the panic, the Mexican Republic was declared (which was decidedly an autocracy) and the Republic of the Philippines (which was more accurate to its name). This “Great Depression” is the name of the game in American politics, and with the next election sure to depose Herbert Hoover, four choices rally support to bring a new look to both domestic and foreign policy, and with the rise of the far right and left since the end of the Great War, where the United States will find itself has never seemed to be in a more precarious position."
US.2.d:0 "Our Army is in a dire need of reform. Lack of clear leadership and generally poor maintainance during the interwar has culminated in a somewhat backwash Army for our nation. The recent adoption of the Pedersen rifle has further put a strain on the Military's budget to make matters worse. \n\nToday, we must make a choice concerning the future of the U.S Army. A handful of Generals have put forward propositions, but only 3 of them stand out.\n\nFirst, we've got Eisenhower's plan. It outlines a large cleanup of leadership and rigorous training to bring the Army up to standards. Second is Patton's plan, which outlines an overhaul of the composition of our military, to transition to a highly mobility-based fighting force. MacArthur's plan outlines bolstering the size of the Army, even advocating different forms of Mobilization.\n\nThe Question remains; who's lead do we follow?"
US.3.d:0 "The U.S Navy isn't in a very good state either. The failure of the 1928 Navy Expansion Program caused naval enthusiasm to wane, and the further downsizing of the USN after the Great Depression hit has also negatively impacted our naval strength. If we're to reassert our naval strength, we're going to need to expand or reform our navy. We could attempt to make our navy carrier-based, alternatively we could focus on what we've always been capable of; strength in numbers."
US.4.d:0 "The U.S.A.F has been lagging behind other Airforces, notably those in Europe. The British and French Airforces dwarf ours, which raises a set of red flags.\n\nWe need to decide on our priorities for the U.S.A.F.\n\nWe could prioritize Bombers, after all, destroying the Enemy's industry will bring their war machine to a grinding halt. On the other hand, we can focus on attempting to get the U.S.A.F. to work with the Army by supporting them in combat."
US.5.d:0 "An explosion rocketed Houston, Texas this morning, causing several deaths and a currently untold number of injuries. Chief suspects of the incident include Mexican nationalists, though local police have not yet ruled out a domestic political group either. Included at the scene is what officers have been identifying as the flag of the Mexican State, though additional forensics research will have to be conducted. The target of the attack is believed to be a rail and trasportation hub in the city, but exactly which is not yet known, either. What is known, however, is that the political climate in the country has taken a drastic turn for the worse, and it will certianly only go downhill from here."
US.6.d:0 "The Southern Serpent might be a more formidable enemy than the look. It'll pay well to ensure that we surround them with satellite-states by their Southern Border. Congress has passed the notion of sending demands to Centroamerica for installation of American-Friendly governments, it's about time we get started."
US.7.d:0 "We've recieved a message from the Americans today! They're demanding that '[Root.GetName] is to become a Protectorate of the United States of America, faliure to comply will be met with force'. The [Root.GetAdjective] people deserve to live in a free and independent country, however the Americans threatening to invade is a very real threat..."
US.8.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective]s are being completely noncompliant. They refuse to accept our demands, citing that it's hardly reasonable for us to demand them to give up their independence out of the blue. \n\nWe've threatened to meet Noncompliance with force, however our Case of War is very weak... Not only that, but it might be internationally safer to drop the matter."
US.9.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective]s have accepted our demand and agreed to become an American Protectorate. We're installing a friendly Government right this moment, this will hopefully ensure that we surround the Mexican menace."
US.10.d:0 "The Southern Serpent might be a more formidable enemy than they look. It'll pay well to ensure that we surround them with American Allies by their Southern Border. Congress has passed the notion of sending offers to Centroamerica for membership in an Alliance of Free Nations, it's about time we get started with distributing the offers."
US.11.d:0 "The Americans have made us an offer, they had proposed that we join an 'Alliance of Free Nations', or nicknamed during the conferences as the 'Free Bloc'. \n\n[Root.GetName] was one of the nations that recieved the invite as per their attempt to better relations with Central America. It certainly has its benifits, however some citizens might see it as us falling into the American Sphere."
US.12.d:0 "[From.GetName] has decided that they would rather decline our invite to the Free Bloc."
US.13.d:0 "[From.GetName] has accepted our invite and have announced they are joining the Free Bloc!"
US.14.d:0 "The Northern bastards have demanded that the Nationalist Government step down and restore the American Puppet Government! Their delegation was oh-so confident that we'd surrender to their petty demands..."
US.15.d:0 "On a quiet, warm day in California, a truck rolled to a checkpoint on the Mexican-American border. The sight started the stationed men in a flurry of activity- such a thing hadn't realy been seen since the tightening of extradition laws months earlier. One of the privates called to the truck, gun at the ready. The truck did not come to a halt. Even though several rounds of ammunition were fired into it, it burst through the wooden fence, leading from one stretch of the road to the other. The fences, which stretched for miles from either side of the checkpoint as an additional safety precaution quaked. The private, too caught up in seeing the other truck through in a shower of metal, turned into the rising sun to see several other trucks emerging through the mirage. They were on a different course however, directly to the see. Directly out to San Diego. Word of the attack reached Washington shortly after. And the military, not long after that."
US.16.d:0 "We've recovered from the Great Depression aproximately a year ago, and have been improving ever since. The economy has been doing much better, and our citizens have been able to actually afford a healthy amount of food. With living standards on the rise and general economic improvement, we can confidently say we are no longer the Sick Man of the Americas."
US.30.d:0 "Early this morning, Eugene V. Debs died of multiple organ failure following an extended period of ailing health. Debs had an extensive history in American politics, having been a union leader who contested Theodore Roosevelt's election campaigns in 1912 and 1916 to less than stellar results. After having narrowly been found innocent of sedition in his condemnation of American actions against Mexico, and by extension to Central Powers, by the Supreme Court, he continued to be a controverial figure. Debs also contested the 1920 Presidential election on the Socialist Party ticket but was again very unsuccessful. While he remained de facto leader of the Socialist Party, he discontinued his runs for President from then on, and the Socialist Party has stagnated ever since, in the major margin of American politics. He appointed some weeks ago journalist and unioneer Jack Reed as his successor, though with Debs's death the transition has become official. Many spectators cannot say exactly what the fate of the party will be now, but it will probably suffer divisions in power following its suzerain leader's death."

USA_field_aid:0 "Field Aid Integration"

USA_reorganized_logistics:0 "Reorganized Logistics"
USA_reorganized_logistics_desc:0 "If we are to function with such a vast reserve of soldiers we are going to need to redesign our current support structure from the ground up.

USA_federal_draft:0 "Desegregate the Military"
USA_federal_draft_desc:0 "The American mainland provides us with an enormous pool of soldiers to pull from, but right now we are only utilizing a portion of it. While we allow both black and white soldiers to volunteer, most coloured soldiers are relegated to non-combat roles. Its time to change this, the more guns on the field the better."
USA_communication_primacy:0 "Communication Primacy"
USA_communication_primacy_desc:0 "With an army of this size communication is key, other wise it could easily become a case of the left hand not knowing what the right is doing which could lead to disaster. We usually use couriers to get orders from one flank to the next but that will be to slow and doesn’t reach past our lines, perhaps radio both in our command buildings and our divisions will solve this."
USA_guns_over_butter:0 "Guns over Butter"
USA_guns_over_butter_desc:0 "We have the men we need, but we just do not have the ability to produce equipment for them fast enough.
